# Introdution

First of all, I'm writing this library just for myself, which means:

1. There **WILL** be a major changes

2. There **WILL** be exceptions

3. There **WILL** be unoptimized or bad code

If you're OK with these, welcome :)

## First steps

If you're on .NET 5, you don't need to initialize anything, just write the code! Otherwise, call `Utilities.Initialize()` somewhere in `Main()`

Take a look at module specific articles or RadLibrary.Tests!
