# Introdution

First of all, I'm writing this library just for myself, which means:

1. There **WILL** be a major changes

2. There **WILL** be exceptions

3. There **WILL** be unoptimized or bad code

If you're OK with these, welcome :)

## First steps

Somewhere in the start of your app, you have to call `Utilities.Initialize()` in order to enable colors in console + initialize formatters storage.
